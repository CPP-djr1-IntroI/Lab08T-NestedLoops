**Points:** 

**This is an individual assignment.**

**Goals:**

1.  Implement nested logic

2.  Validate input

3.  Continue using the debugger


**Lab 8.1**

Write a complete C++ program in a project called **TriangleSum** that
will ask the user for a single digit integer greater than 0. Validate
the input and ask the user for input until a valid integer is given.

Use the integer given by the user to build a right triangle on the
screen. The size of the triangle should be based on the integer given.
The length of the sides of the triangle should be equal to the input
integer. Calculate the **sum** **of each row in the triangle** and the
**sum** **of all the integers in the triangle**. Sample input and output
follows:

<pre>
*** Integer Triangle ***

Please enter a single digit, positive, non-zero integer: 10
Please enter a single digit, positive, non-zero integer: 3

Here is your Triangle:
  1 sum: 1
 22 sum: 4
333 sum: 9
    sum: 14

*** Integer Triangle ***

Please enter a single digit, positive, non-zero integer: 5

Here is your Triangle:
    1 sum: 1
   22 sum: 4
  333 sum: 9
 4444 sum: 16
55555 sum: 25
      sum: 55
</pre>

**To complete this assignment you must submit the following:**

1.  **An electronic Solution of your program on GitHub**

    a.  You are to click on the Lab08 Link on The C++ Tutorials in the section Data Input to accept this
        assignment as we've done before. Once accepted, code up a
        complete solution to each project specified above. Your
        complete solution is to be pushed to GitHub no later than the
        date and time specified above for your specific section. I will
        only grade your solution from the proper location on GitHub.

    b.  Pay attention to the example output above. Your program's output
        must look **exactly** like the example output! The spacing and
        newlines in your output must match exactly.

    c.  Make sure that your program compiles and runs correctly with no
        errors and no warnings. If you get any errors, double check that
        you typed everything correctly. Be aware that C++ is
        case-sensitive.

2.  **An electronic pdf (punetidLab08NestedLoops.pdf) 
of your program is to be emailed to ryandj@pacificu.edu**
